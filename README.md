# SDN-Replication
SDN-Replication is a PyTorch-based framework for implementing Shallow-Deep Networks, allowing internal classifiers (ICs) to produce predictions at multiple depths of a CNN. It enables analysis and mitigation of overthinking by supporting early exits and confusion-based error diagnostics.
